#+title: Creme Brulee

- bring almost to boil 400 ml of 30% cream, put inside a split vanilla pod + seeds. Let infuse for 15+ minutes, until lukewarm.
- Mix 4 egg yolks with salt and 80g of sugar. Do not beat.
- Strain the cream and gradually mix into yolks
- Strain again when putting inside ramekins or baking tray.
- Bake using water bath 150C static (no fan). Middle part should wobble like jelly.
  - Hint: put a towel between ramekins or glass tray AND baking tray -- this way water prevents direct contact between the tray and glass

- Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2  hours.
